# Enhanced Coverage Analysis System

A comprehensive standalone coverage analysis tool that provides detailed coverage metrics for individual test files.

## Features

- **Multiple Coverage Types**: Line, Branch, Function, and Conditional coverage
- **Focused Analysis**: Analyzes only the specific test file and its corresponding source module
- **Rich Reporting**: Both terminal and HTML coverage reports
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects which source module a test file is testing
- **Independent Operation**: Completely separate from the main pipeline

## Coverage Types Explained

### 1. Line Coverage (Statement Coverage)
- **What it measures**: Which lines of code were executed during testing
- **Importance**: Basic metric showing how much of your code is tested
- **Output**: Percentage of lines executed + list of missed lines

### 2. Branch Coverage
- **What it measures**: Which code branches (if/else, loops, etc.) were taken
- **Importance**: Ensures all possible execution paths are tested
- **Output**: Percentage of branches covered + detailed branch analysis

### 3. Function Coverage
- **What it measures**: Which functions/methods were called during testing
- **Importance**: Ensures all functions are tested at least once
- **Output**: List of all functions and their coverage status

### 4. Conditional Coverage
- **What it measures**: Which conditional expressions were evaluated
- **Importance**: Ensures complex boolean logic is properly tested
- **Output**: Analysis of if statements, while loops, and boolean expressions

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python coverage_analysis/run_coverage_analysis.py <test_file_name>
```

### Examples

**Using just the test file name:**
```bash
python coverage_analysis/run_coverage_analysis.py llm_generated_test_sample_utility
```

**Using relative path:**
```bash
python coverage_analysis/run_coverage_analysis.py tests/test_suites/llm_generated_test_sample_number
```

**For pynguin tests:**
```bash
python coverage_analysis/run_coverage_analysis.py pynguin_generated_test_sample_calculator
```

## Output

### Terminal Output
The script provides comprehensive terminal output including:

1. **Initialization Info**: Project paths and setup confirmation
2. **File Detection**: Test file and source module identification
3. **Coverage Execution**: Real-time pytest execution with coverage
4. **Coverage Summary**: Line and branch coverage percentages
5. **Function Analysis**: List of all functions and their coverage
6. **Conditional Analysis**: Analysis of conditional statements
7. **Report Locations**: Paths to generated coverage files

### Generated Files

1. **Coverage Data File**: `.coverage` file with raw coverage data
2. **HTML Report**: Interactive HTML coverage report with detailed analysis
3. **Configuration File**: `.coveragerc` with enhanced coverage settings

## Technical Details

### Automatic Source Detection
The script automatically detects which source module a test file is testing by:
1. Analyzing import statements in the test file
2. Matching test file naming patterns
3. Looking for corresponding source files in `tests/source/`

### Coverage Configuration
Enhanced `.coveragerc` configuration includes:
- Branch coverage enabled
- Source directory specification
- Exclusion of test files and virtual environments
- Missing line reporting
- HTML report customization

### File Structure Requirements
- **Test Files**: Must be in `tests/test_suites/` or subdirectories
- **Source Files**: Must be in `tests/source/`
- **Virtual Environment**: Automatically detected and used if available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Not Found Error:**
```
FileNotFoundError: Test file not found: test_name.py
```
- Ensure the test file exists in `tests/test_suites/`
- Check the file name spelling
- Try using the full relative path

**Source Module Detection Failed:**
```
ValueError: Could not detect source module for test file
```
- Ensure the corresponding source file exists in `tests/source/`
- Check that the test file has proper import statements
- Verify the naming convention matches

**Import Errors During Testing:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'
```
- Ensure the source module is in `tests/source/`
- Check that `__init__.py` files exist if needed
- Verify the Python path is set correctly

### Debug Mode
For additional debugging information, you can examine:
- The generated `.coveragerc` file
- Coverage data files in `reports/` directory
- HTML reports for detailed line-by-line analysis
