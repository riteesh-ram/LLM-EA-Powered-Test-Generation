# mutants_validation Directory

This directory implements the mutation testing pipeline, which evaluates and strengthens the effectiveness of your test suite by introducing controlled code changes (mutants) and measuring how well your tests detect them. It provides tools for mutant generation, analysis, testing, scoring, and survivor handling.

---

## Module Overview

### 1. `mutant_generator.py` & `pipeline_mutant_generator.py`
**Functionality:**
- Automatically generates multiple mutated versions of the source code, each with a single, small change (mutation).
- Supports various mutation types: arithmetic, comparison, logical, constant changes, and statement deletions.
- Saves mutants in the `generated_mutants/` directory for further analysis and testing.

**Key Details:**
- Ensures each mutant is isolated and traceable.
- Can be run standalone or as part of a pipeline.

---

### 2. `mutant_diff_analyzer.py`
**Functionality:**
- Compares each mutant file to the original source code.
- Records and reports the exact changes made in each mutant for transparency and review.

**Key Details:**
- Generates diff reports to help understand what each mutant tests.
- Useful for debugging and survivor analysis.

---

### 3. `mutant_tester.py`
**Functionality:**
- Runs the test suite against each mutant to determine if the tests detect the change (kill the mutant) or not (mutant survives).
- Isolates test runs for each mutant in a temporary environment (`temp_test_dir/`).

**Key Details:**
- Records which mutants are killed and which survive.
- Handles timeouts, crashes, and collects detailed test results.

---

### 4. `mutation_score_calculator.py`
**Functionality:**
- Calculates the mutation score, a quantitative measure of test suite effectiveness:
  - Mutation Score = (Number of killed mutants) / (Total mutants)
- Provides detailed breakdowns by mutation type and code location.

**Key Details:**
- Higher scores indicate stronger, more sensitive tests.
- Reports help guide further test improvements.

---

### 5. `survived_mutant_detector.py`
**Functionality:**
- Identifies mutants that survived (were not detected by any test).
- Highlights weak spots in the test suite for targeted improvement.

**Key Details:**
- Generates survival reports for review and prioritization.
- Essential for continuous test suite enhancement.

---

### 6. `survivor_killer_integrated.py`
**Functionality:**
- Attempts to generate new, targeted tests to kill survived mutants.
- Can leverage LLM assistance to create more precise assertions and test cases.

**Key Details:**
- Closes the loop by patching holes in the test suite.
- Supports iterative improvement and re-testing.

---

## Supporting Directories
- `generated_mutants/`: Stores all mutant files for each source module.
- `mutpy_env/`: Environment for running mutation tests (e.g., dependencies, isolation).
- `temp_test_dir/`: Temporary directory for isolated test execution.

---

## Key Workflow
1. **Generate mutants** using `mutant_generator.py` or `pipeline_mutant_generator.py`.
2. **Analyze differences** with `mutant_diff_analyzer.py`.
3. **Test mutants** using `mutant_tester.py` to determine killed/survived status.
4. **Calculate mutation score** with `mutation_score_calculator.py`.
5. **Detect survivors** using `survived_mutant_detector.py`.
6. **Generate targeted tests** for survivors with `survivor_killer_integrated.py`.
7. **Iterate and improve** the test suite for higher mutation scores and robustness.

## Important Notes
- Mutation testing is a powerful way to measure and improve test suite quality.
- Survived mutants indicate areas where tests may be too weak or missing.
- The pipeline supports automated and manual review, as well as LLM-assisted test enhancement.
- Regular mutation testing helps maintain strong, bug-resistant code as your project evolves.

---

## Usage
- Use this directory to evaluate, report, and strengthen your test suite.
- Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline for continuous quality assurance.
- Review mutation and survivor reports to guide targeted test improvements.
