Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Pynguin was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.

#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

We furthermore like the thoughts and ideas from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code*.
All contributions to Pynguin should keep these important rules in mind.

Theses on Pynguin
-----------------

This is an (incomplete) list of theses done on Pynguin.

* A. Hajdari: **Enhancing Automated Unit Testing for Machine Learning Libraries
  Based on API Constraints**. Master's Thesis. University of Passau, 2025.

  Added API-Documentation parsing and test generation for libraries which require
  tensor inputs based on the parsed constraints.

* A. Abdelillah: **Exploring LLM Integration into Automated Unit Test Generation**.
  Master's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2025.

  Integrated LLM querying, including prompting, parsing and the LLMOSAAlgorithm.
* G. Oberreuter Álvarez: **Effects of the Implementation of a Graph-Based Object Synthesis
  Heuristic on Pynguin**. Master's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2024.

  Adds a object-synthesis heuristic for the test generation based on generation graphs.
* L. Berg: **Improving automated unit test generation for machine learning libraries using
  structured input data**.  Master's Thesis.  University of Namur, 2024.

  Provides an approach to generate more structured input data and to run Pynguin more reliably on
  native-code libraries.
* F. Kroiß: **Type Tracing: Using Runtime Information to Improve Automated Unit-test Generation
  for Python**. Master's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2023.

  Provides an approach to infer and refine missing and existing type information based on the
  execution of the generated test cases.
* S. Labrenz: **Using Checked Coverage as Fitness Function for Test Generation in
  Python**.  Master's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2022.

  Provides checked coverage both as a fitness function for test generation as well as an
  optimisation criterion for assertion minimisation.
* M. Königseder: **DeepTyper für Python und der Einfluss von Typvorhersagen auf die
  automatische Testgenerierung**. Bachelor's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2022.

* M. Reichenberger: **Measuring Oracle Quality in Python**.  Master's Thesis.  University
  of Passau, 2022.

  Although this work did not directly contribute to Pynguin, its implementation of
  Checked Coverage was the basis for the thesis of S. Labrenz.
* F. Straubinger: **Mutation Analysis to Improve the Generation of Assertions for
  Automatically Generated Python Unit-tests**.  Bachelor's Thesis.  University of Passau,
  2021.

  Provided the mutation-based assertion generation for improved regression tests.
* L. Steffens: **Seeding Strategies in Search-Based Unit Test Generation for Python**.
  Bachelor's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2021.

  Provided the dynamic seeding as well as the seeding from existing test cases to
  Pynguin.
* F. Kroiß: **Automatic Generation of Whole Test Suites in Python**.  Bachelor's Thesis.
  University of Passau, 2020.

  Provided the whole-suite test generation algorithm as well as large parts of the core
  parts of Pynguin, e.g., instrumentation, test-case representation, and execution.
* C. Frädrich: **Combining Test Generation and Type Inference for Testing Dynamically
  Typed Programming Language**.  Master's Thesis.  University of Passau, 2019.

  Implemented a proof-of-concept using a Randoop-like test-generation algorithm and
  incorporated several ideas for type inference.  Although this work was done before
  Pynguin was actually startet, it is the foundation and proof-of-concept that test
  generation for Python was actually a feasible goal.  Thus, we consider it as the
  seminal starting point of this endeavour.
